  Custom cumsum splits first axis into chunks to avoid accumulation error.
  Just taking tf.sin(tf.cumsum(angular_frequency)) leads to accumulation of
  phase errors that are audible for long segments or at high sample rates. Also,
  in reduced precision settings, cumsum can overflow the threshold.

  consider using angular_sum to avoid noticible phase errors. This version is
  currently activated by global gin injection. Set the gin parameter

  Given that we are going to take the sin of the accumulated phase anyways, we
  don't care about the phase modulo 2 pi. This code chops the incoming frequency
  into chunks, applies cumsum to each chunk, takes mod 2pi, and then stitches
  them back together by adding the cumulative values of the final step of each
  chunk to the next chunk.

    """Filter audio with frames of time-varying finite impulse responses.
    Time-varying filter. Given audio [batch, n_samples], and a series of impulse
    responses [batch, n_frames, n_impulse_response], splits the audio into frames
    of given length and overlap, applies filters, and then overlap-and-adds audio back together.
    Applies windowed overlapping STFT/ISTFT.

    Args:
      audio: Input audio. Tensor of shape [batch, audio_timesteps].
      impulse_response: Finite impulse response to convolve. Can either be a 2-D
        Tensor of shape [batch, ir_size], or a 3-D Tensor of shape [batch,
        ir_frames, ir_size]. A 2-D tensor will apply a single linear
        time-invariant filter to the audio. A 3-D Tensor will apply a linear
        time-varying filter. Automatically chops the audio into equally shaped
        blocks to match ir_frames.
      audio_frame_size: length of frames to cut the audio signal. Should be even and
        should be equal to the fft length which has been used on the input audio signal
        to the encoder.
      audio_frame_overlap: overlap of frames to cut the audio signal. Should be 0.5 or 0.75
        and should be equal to the overlap that has been used for the STFT on the input
        audio signal to the encoder.
      padding: Either 'valid' or 'same'. For 'same' the final output to be the
        same size as the input audio (audio_timesteps). For 'valid' the audio is
        extended to include the tail of the impulse response (audio_timesteps +
        ir_timesteps - 1).
      delay_compensation: Samples to crop from start of output audio to compensate
        for group delay of the impulse response. If delay_compensation is less
        than 0 it defaults to automatically calculating a constant group delay of
        the windowed linear phase filter from frequency_impulse_response().
